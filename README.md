# Smart Sorting: Transfer Learning for Identifying Rotten Fruits and Vegetables

## Project Description
Smart Sorting is an AI-powered image classification system that automates the process of detecting rotten fruits and vegetables using deep learning. The system addresses inefficiencies in manual sorting—common in supermarkets, food processing units, and storage facilities—by leveraging pre-trained CNN models through transfer learning to perform high-accuracy classification in real time.

##  Proposed Solution
The solution uses transfer learning with pre-trained models such as ResNet, VGG, and MobileNet, fine-tuned on a curated dataset of fruit and vegetable images. It is deployed as a web application with a user-friendly interface and RESTful API support, enabling:

Real-time image classification (fresh vs. rotten)

High classification accuracy (>92%)

Scalable architecture suitable for enterprise use

Easy integration with existing food sorting systems

Confidence score with results and performance logging

## Technology Stack

## Dataset Used

Name: Healthy vs Rotten Fruits and Vegetables Image Dataset

Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammad0subhan/fruit-and-vegetable-disease-healthy-vs-rotten]

Contents: Thousands of labeled images across different fruit and vegetable types categorized as fresh or rotten

Augmentation: Applied for improved generalization (flip, rotate, zoom)

## Conclusion

Smart Sorting provides an effective, scalable, and cost-efficient solution to the persistent problem of food waste and quality control in supply chains. With an accuracy of 92.5%, it significantly improves operational efficiency, reduces foodborne risks, and enhances sustainability goals.

The project serves as a robust template for future advancements such as:

Multi-class and severity classification

Edge and mobile deployment

Integration with robotic and conveyor belt systems
